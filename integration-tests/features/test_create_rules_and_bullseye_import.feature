Feature: GoogleTestWithBullseyeAndVsProject

  This test verifies that analysis is able to import bullseye coverage reports and import custom rules reports.
  Custom rules are created using Rest API, after test ends rules are deleted.
  Bullseye reports need to be created before running the test.

  Scenario: GoogleTestWithBullseyeAndVsProject
      GIVEN the project "googletest_bullseye_vs_project"
        and rule "rats:getenv" is enabled
        and rule "cpplint_legal_copyright_0" is created based on "other:CustomRuleTemplate" in repository "other"
        and rule "cpplint_build_header_guard_0" is created based on "other:CustomRuleTemplate" in repository "other"
        and rule "cpplint_whitespace_indent_2" is created based on "other:CustomRuleTemplate" in repository "other"
        and rule "cpplint_whitespace_parens_5" is created based on "other:CustomRuleTemplate" in repository "other"
        and rule "cpplint_whitespace_line_length_1" is created based on "other:CustomRuleTemplate" in repository "other"
        and rule "cpplint_tekla_custom_include_files_0" is created based on "other:CustomRuleTemplate" in repository "other"
      WHEN I run "sonar-runner -X"
      THEN the analysis finishes successfully
          AND the analysis log contains no error/warning messages except those matching:
