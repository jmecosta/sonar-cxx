Feature: Providing test execution numbers

  As a SonarQube user
  I want to import the test execution reports into SonarQube
  In order to have the text execution metrics in SonarQube and use such SonarQube features as:
  - continuous monitoring of those metrics
  - Quality Gates on top of those metrics
  - Overview over the test execution status
  - ...

  # |
  # | Specification:
  # | * The plugin is able to import test which conform to the schema
  # |   described in xunit.rnc Note: some test frameworks (QUnit,
  # |   AFAIK), skip the top-tag 'testsuites'. Those report are
  # |   compatible with the element testsuite of the schema and can be
  # |   imported too.
  # |
  # | * Additionally, the plugin is able to import every XML format 'X'
  # |   when given an XSLT-sheet, which performs the X->JUnitReport
  # |   conversion (This feature should really be deprecated...)
  # |
  # | * It supports two modes: 'simple' and the 'detailed' (switched
  # |   via the parameter -Dsonar.cxx.xunit.provideDetails). In simple
  # |   mode it just aggregates the measures contained in the reports
  # |   and saves the result in the project, skipping all the testcase
  # |   details. In detailed mode, the plugin tries to find the
  # |   resources (=test source files) where the testcases are
  # |   implemented in and saves the measures to those resources.
  # |
  # | * To locate the test source file for assigning, there are
  # |   two strategies:
  # |   1. If either the testcase-tag or the enclosing testsuite tag
  # |      contains the attribute 'filename', its content is assumed
  # |      to contain a relative path to the according test source
  # |      file. Filename in testcase overwrites filename in testsuite
  # |      if both are present.
  # |   2. Via parsing the test files and trying to find the values of
  # |      'classname' in the resulting AST's. This requires the test
  # |      sources to be actually parsable.

  Scenario: Importing unchanged googletest reports in default mode

      By default, the plugin doesn't try to assign the testcases
      found in the report to test files in Sonar, it just sums up
      all the measures and assigns it to the project. This makes the
      procedure more stable but doesn't provide the details for the
      testcases in SonarQube, i.e. the drilldown wont be possible.

      GIVEN the project "googletest_project"

      WHEN I run "sonar-runner -X -Dsonar.cxx.xunit.reportPath=gtest_without_fixture.xml"

      THEN the analysis finishes successfully
          AND the analysis log contains no error/warning messages except those matching:
              """
              .*WARN.*cannot find the sources for '#include <gtest/gtest\.h>'
              .*WARN.*cannot find the sources for '#include <unistd\.h>'
              """
          AND the following metrics have following values:
              | metric               | value |

  Scenario Outline: Importing unchanged googletest reports in detailed mode

      Testcases in googletest reports do not know the source file they come
      from. The plugin is able to fill this gap for a subset of testcases
      (currently those which use a fixture) using the 'lookup the classnames
      in the AST'-approach. This doesn't work for all testcases, though
